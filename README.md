(Yet another) Dead-simple PHP wiki. Responsive layout, LESS, Markdown.

Basically, I really liked [gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum/) but wanted something I could drop in any old folder on any old Apache server and have an instant wiki.

## Installation

- Download all the files
- Put them in a folder on your Apache server
- Navigate to that folder in your browser
- Start wikifying
