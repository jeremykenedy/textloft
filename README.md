Textloft
========

(Yet another) Dead-simple PHP wiki. Responsive layout, LESS, Markdown, iOS web-app capable and HTML5 rolled into a tiny little package.

Basically, I really liked [gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum/) but wanted something I could drop in any old folder on any old Apache server and have an instant wiki.

## Installation

- Download all the files
- Put them in a folder on your Apache server
- Navigate to that folder in your browser
- Start wikifying

## Installing with Git

Because it's ready to go out of the box you can do a simple install via Git by simple cloning the repository into the folder you want your wiki in.

- SSH into your server. 
- Type: `git clone https://github.com/snaptortoise/textloft.git textloft`
- You can change "textloft" to whatever you want.
- Done! Your wiki now lives at http:///yourawesomewebsite.com/textloft

If you choose to install via Git it comes with an extra perk: quick and easy updates! Assuming you haven't touched any of the core files you can update Textloft at any time by navigating to the folder your wiki lives in and typing `git pull`.
